                    <h3>Beginner</h3>
                    <p>"Coding" is a commonly used term for computer programming. Some people use it interchangeably with programming, while others would argue they are not entirely the same.

                        By definition, "code" refers to a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. Computers don't understand human language,
                        so over time, humans have created languages that computers can understand. And developers speak to them through those languages.

                    <h3>Advance</h3>
                    <p>A common mistake beginners do while learning programming is just reading a book or looking at the sample code on their desktop
                        without practicing it. You really need to get your hands dirty in coding and keep practicing it regularly.
                        When you start programming you face a lot of problems, you get stuck there, you will be asked to implement the code practically
                        and find the solution for a specific problem and there you will scratch your head while implementing the code.  </p>

                    <p>'How to Become a Expert Programmer' is a practical guide that teaches anyone what they need to know in order to become a successful programmer.

                        You already know that knowing how to code is increasingly becoming an important skill to have. But what often isn't clear is what the steps are to becoming a professional developer.
                        
                        It isn't enough to tell someone “Just pick a programming language" or “Just build an app".

                        by American philosopher John Dewey. It’s a hands-on approach to learning where students interact with their
                        environment to adapt and learn. ​​Learning by doing is the idea that we learn more when we actually “do” the activity.

                    <p>I really like how the instructor explains everything slowly and from scratch so that even those who have absolutely no background in programming or anything web-related can clearly understand what is going on. I am reviewing this midway though the second module. If this is how the whole course is going to unfold, highly recommended!.</p>

                    <p>beginners will not learn from this, all he's teaching is display block and there is more then that, since i started watching these videos all i've got is half assed lessons. make the course longer so you can go full depth on everything this is really bad, would not recommend for beginners</p>
